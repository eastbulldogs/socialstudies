title: Take Glory
---

Standing before the gathered crowd in the castle's great hall, you savor your moment of triumph. "The judges have chosen well," you announce proudly. "This victory proves that true talent and dedication will always rise to the top." You see Master Gilbert nodding approvingly, while other students shift uncomfortably at the edges of the hall.

The castle steward steps forward to present you with a golden ladle – the traditional prize for winning the competition. As he drapes a blue winner's sash across your chest, you catch glimpses of different faces in the crowd. Clara's student, who struggled with their dish, looks down at the floor. Thomas, who had once shown you his special technique for searing meat, turns away.

But their reactions hardly matter now. You're the winner, the best young cook in the castle. That's what counts, isn't it?

Word of your victory spreads quickly. Nobles begin requesting your dishes specifically, and Master Gilbert proudly tells everyone about his "star pupil." You spend more time creating elaborate presentations for important guests, and less time working alongside the other students. They watch you from a distance now, whispering among themselves.

One evening, as you're preparing a special dish for visiting knights, you overhear two senior cooks talking. "Reminds me of yourself at that age," one says to Master Gilbert. "So much talent... and the same pride that almost ruined you." You pretend not to hear, but the words stick in your mind.

The next morning, the castle steward makes an announcement that makes your heart race: a grand tournament is coming, with competitions in every skill – including cooking. Winners will have their names recorded in the castle's great book of honors, remembered forever.

"You should enter," Master Gilbert tells you. "Show everyone that your victory wasn't just luck." But something feels different now. The other students who used to share tips and techniques avoid your gaze. When you try asking Thomas about a new spice blend he's using, he politely declines to share his "personal recipe."

You realize that while you've gained fame, you've lost something too. The kitchen that once felt like home now feels more like a stage where you must constantly prove yourself. Every dish must be perfect, every presentation flawless. The joy of cooking is being replaced by the pressure to remain on top.

The golden ladle gleams on your shelf, but somehow its shine doesn't seem as bright as the memory of sharing recipes and laughing over failed experiments with your fellow students.
