"Keep up!" calls Thomas, the young messenger who's showing you the ropes. You jog behind him, trying to memorize the twisting corridors and hidden passages of Blackthorn Castle. Thomas seems to know every shortcut, every guard post, and every squeaky floorboard to avoid.

"A good messenger is like a ghost in the castle walls," he explains, leading you up a narrow servant's staircase. "We see everything but stay invisible." Throughout the day, you help deliver messages to what feels like every corner of the castle – from the knight's quarters to the lord's solar, from the guard towers to the deepest cellars.

You're learning fast. Already you can tell the difference between a regular guard patrol and the captain's inspection rounds. You know which corridors to use during meal times to avoid the rush of servants, and which windows provide the quickest views of approaching visitors.

As the sun begins to set, Thomas hands you a sealed message to deliver to the castle steward. "Last task of the day," he says. "Remember – third door past the tapestry of the hunting scene." But as you take the message, you notice something odd. There's a second piece of parchment stuck to the back, partially hidden, with what looks like a coded message written in charcoal.
