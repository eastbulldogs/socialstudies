title: Careful Plan
---

Instead of rushing into action, you spend days preparing your plan to catch the spy. Every detail matters - from mapping guard patrol routes to studying the moon's phases to know exactly how dark each night will be. Your messenger training helps you create the perfect cover story for being in different parts of the castle.

"A good plan is like a well-made sword," Thomas tells you while reviewing your preparations. "Strong enough to work, but flexible enough not to break when things get complicated." You take his words to heart, building backup plans for your backup plans.

You recruit help carefully - just two trusted guards and one kitchen worker who can alert you when the suspect is eating. You create a simple signal system using normal castle activities: a swept doorway here, a positioned cart there, all looking perfectly ordinary to anyone who doesn't know what to watch for.

When you discover the spy plans to meet their bandit contacts on the night of the harvest feast, you realize it's perfect timing. The castle will be busy, making your movements less noticeable, but you'll also have to be extra careful not to raise suspicion among the many visitors.

After a final check of your preparations, you gather your small team in the messenger's quiet courtyard. Every person knows their role, every signal is memorized, every escape route is covered. Now you face your most crucial choice:
