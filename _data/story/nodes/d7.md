Over the next few weeks, you become a quiet bridge between the castle and village. Each evening, you help Marta sort through the day's unused food, carefully setting aside items that would normally be thrown out. Sarah - the girl you first caught in the storage room - helps distribute these supplies to families who need them most.

You learn more about village life through whispered conversations. The drought has made everything harder, with failed crops and closed mills leaving many without work. But the villagers support each other, sharing what little they have. They begin to trust you with their stories, treating you as one of their own rather than just another castle resident.

Then one gray morning, Sarah arrives at the kitchen door earlier than usual, her face pale with worry. "Bandits," she whispers. "They've been watching the village. Last night they told us they expect a share of all food that comes from the castle - including what you've been helping us with. If we don't pay, they threatened to raid both the village and the castle stores."

Your blood runs cold. This is much bigger than sneaking a few leftovers to hungry families. The bandits must have noticed the improved condition of some villagers and figured out there was a new source of food. Sarah continues, "The village elders are meeting tonight to decide what to do. We need your help, but this could get dangerous."

The weight of many lives rests on your decision. You've earned the villagers' trust - but what's the best way to use it? Either choice carries serious risks, and you'll have to live with the consequences.

You have to make a choice:
- Help the villagers prepare to fight off the bandits
- Try to negotiate a solution that protects both village and castle
