You choose to help the villagers fight. "We can't let bandits bully us," you tell Sarah firmly. "And we can't let them threaten the castle either."

Over the next few days, you help organize the villagers in secret. Your messenger training proves useful as you coordinate between different groups without drawing attention. You teach them tricks you learned in the castle about staying hidden and moving quietly. The villagers share their own knowledge too - which paths are best for ambushes, how to use farming tools as weapons if needed.

The blacksmith's daughter shows everyone how to make simple shields from barrel lids. The miller's sons, who know every hidden spot around their mill, plan perfect places for lookouts. Even the elderly contribute, with Old Martha mixing special herbs that will make the night watchdogs sleep deeply when the time comes.

The night of the bandits' return arrives all too quickly. Your heart pounds as you take your position with a group of villagers near the main road. The plan is to surround the bandits when they come to collect their "payment." You grip the wooden staff you've been practicing with - not quite a knight's sword, but it will have to do.

You hear the bandits before you see them. They're laughing, obviously expecting no resistance. But as they reach the center of the village, they find themselves surrounded by determined villagers emerging from the shadows.

"Leave our village," you call out, trying to sound braver than you feel. "And don't come back."

The bandits' leader draws his sword with an ugly smile. "Well, well. Looks like we need to teach these villagers a lesson."

The villagers watch you intently, ready to follow your lead. Everything depends on what you do next.
