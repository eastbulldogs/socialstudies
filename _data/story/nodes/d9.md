You spend the next few days watching and listening carefully. Your messenger duties give you the perfect excuse to be almost anywhere in the castle. You start noticing things you hadn't before - like how the mysterious merchants always seem to be having quiet conversations with certain guards, or how they pass small packages when they think no one's looking.

You begin keeping a journal of everything you see, writing in a simple code Thomas taught you. Each day brings new clues. The merchants' fancy clothes don't quite fit right - almost as if they're costumes. And their "trading goods" are always in sealed crates that seem unusually heavy for their size.

Late one evening, while delivering a message to the guard tower, you overhear two of the merchants arguing in hushed voices. "The east gate... two nights from now... weapons ready..." Your heart pounds as you carefully back away from their hiding spot.

Everything starts falling into place. These aren't merchants at all - they're planning to smuggle weapons into the castle! And some of the guards must be helping them. But who can you trust with this information? You've discovered more than you bargained for.

Just then, you round a corner and almost bump into Thomas. He looks at you strangely, as if he knows something's wrong. "I've noticed you watching those merchants," he says quietly. "Found anything interesting?"

The fate of the castle might depend on your next words. Should you share everything you know, or hold something back in case there are more traitors than you realize?
