title: Accept Offer
---

Your heart races as you tell Cedric you've decided to accept the knight's offer. Though you see a flicker of disappointment in the stable master's eyes, he nods with understanding. "Sir Roland is a good man," he says. "Strict, but fair. You'll learn much from him."

Sir Roland wastes no time putting you to work. Your days become a whirlwind of new tasks and challenges. You learn to care for his armor, memorize the proper titles for different nobles, and run errands throughout the castle. It's very different from the quiet routine of the stables, but you find yourself enjoying the variety.

The knight watches everything you do with keen eyes. When you make mistakes, his corrections are firm but patient. "A knight's squire must understand both action and diplomacy," he often says. You notice he pays special attention to how you handle difficult situations - like when you carefully smooth over a misunderstanding between two kitchen servants, or when you stay calm while dealing with an angry merchant.

After several weeks, Sir Roland calls you to his study. "You've proven yourself capable," he says, "but now you face a choice. The Spring Trials are approaching - a public competition where squires demonstrate their skills before the entire court. It would be a chance to prove your worth to everyone." He pauses thoughtfully. "However, I also have important work that needs doing quietly, behind the scenes. Less glory, perhaps, but just as vital to the castle's well-being."

The decision feels momentous. Will you seek to shine before all, or find your worth in private service? Sir Roland seems willing to support either path - but which one truly calls to you?
