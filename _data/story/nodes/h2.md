Your bold plan falls apart almost immediately. As you rush to signal the castle guards, your foot catches on a root, sending you stumbling into the moonlight. The spy spots you instantly – you realize too late that a senior guard's training would include detecting followers. "We have a shadow!" he calls out, his voice carrying through the night air.

The bandits emerge from their hiding spots around the old mill, cutting off your escape routes. Everything happens too quickly – your carefully planned signal gets tangled in your messenger's bag, the backup plan you arranged with the castle guards now useless. You try to dodge away using Thomas's teachings, but the bandits know these woods too well.

"Well, well," the spy laughs as two bandits grab your arms. "A brave little messenger, trying to play hero." Your heart sinks as you watch the spy and bandits quickly gather their evidence and disappear into the forest. By the time the castle guards arrive, responding to the commotion, all they find is you, shaken but unhurt.

The walk back to the castle feels endless. You can't stop thinking about all the things you could have done differently – waited for better timing, planned more carefully, asked for help. Your cheeks burn with shame as you report your failure to the guard captain.

But something unexpected happens. Instead of anger, the captain and Thomas exchange thoughtful looks. "Courage without preparation is like a sword without a handle," Thomas says gently. "But you can learn from this. The question is – what will you do with this lesson?"

As you consider your options, you understand that being humbled doesn't mean being defeated. Sometimes the path to becoming a true knight takes unexpected turns, and even failures can point the way forward.

You realize he's right. This failure doesn't have to be the end of your story. Maybe it's really just the beginning of understanding what you still need to learn. You have to make a choice:
