Your heart races as you hurry to find Thomas. "I have to tell you everything," you say, pulling him into a quiet corner. "The merchants, the east gate, the weapons - it's all connected, and it's worse than we thought."

Thomas listens intently as you explain what you've discovered. You show him your carefully coded notes about the suspicious meetings, the strange packages, and the guard schedule changes. When you describe the symbols you recognized from the weapon crates, his face grows increasingly serious.

"There's more," you continue, your voice barely a whisper. "I recognized one of the guards involved - someone high-ranking. And I think some of the castle servants are helping them too." You name names carefully, knowing each one could change lives forever.

The weight lifts from your shoulders as you share every detail. Thomas nods grimly and leads you straight to the captain of the guard. For the next hour, you tell your story again, answering their sharp questions with everything you know. You can see the captain's expression darkening as he realizes how deep the plot goes.

"You understand what this means?" the captain asks finally. "Some of the people you've named have powerful friends. Speaking truth to power is noble, but it can be dangerous. You could still keep some details to yourself - protect yourself a bit."

You think about the faces of the people you've named, some of them people you see every day in the castle. But you also think about what could happen if the plotters succeed.

The captain watches you carefully, understanding the weight of your decision. Speaking the whole truth might be right, but you're starting to realize how much it might cost.
