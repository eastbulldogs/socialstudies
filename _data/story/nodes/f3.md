Your role supporting Marcus has made you both better riders. As the feast day performance draws closer, other training groups start asking for your advice. Word spreads about how well your team works together – how you notice the small problems before they become big ones, how you help nervous riders gain confidence, how you seem to know exactly when someone needs help.

One afternoon, Sara's group approaches with an interesting offer. "We've been watching how your team practices," she says. "We have the opening performance slot at the feast, but we're struggling with some of the moves. Maybe we could train together? Share what we each do best?"

Marcus thinks it's a great idea. Soon, both groups are practicing together in the yard. Sara's team is amazing at complex formations, while your group excels at individual skill. When you combine these strengths, something special starts to happen.

"This is better than I imagined," Marcus tells you one evening after practice. "We could do something really incredible at the feast – both groups performing together instead of separately. Show everyone what happens when rivals become allies."

But not everyone loves the idea. Some of your original team members worry about losing what makes your group special. "We worked hard to develop our own style," one says. "What if it gets lost in the bigger group?"

Your decision will affect not just the performance, but the future of both teams. Which path feels right to you?

The feast is only days away. You have to make a choice:
- Stand together with Sara's team and create something bigger than yourselves
- Break away and return to focusing on your own group's growth
