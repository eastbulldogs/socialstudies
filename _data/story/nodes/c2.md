title: Get Help
---

You quickly back away from the frightened stallion, your heart pounding. "Cedric!" you call out. "The rope - it's tangled around his leg!" 

As you move to get help, you keep your eyes on the horse, remembering your morning lessons about staying aware of spooked animals. Other stable hands are already moving to create a barrier with their bodies, keeping the horse from bolting toward the castle gates.

Cedric arrives quickly, his expression focused but not angry. "Good eye spotting that rope, lad," he says as he directs two experienced handlers to approach the horse from different angles. "And even better judgment knowing when to call for help. Too many young ones try to be heroes and end up getting themselves or the horse hurt."

You watch carefully as the stable hands work together to calm and free the stallion, noticing how they use many of the techniques you learned this morning, but with practiced skill that comes from years of experience. The horse gradually settles, and soon the dangerous situation is resolved.

Later, as you help rub down the now-calm stallion, an older knight approaches the stables. He's been watching everything from the practice yard. "The boy showed wisdom today," he tells Cedric. "We need squires who know both their capabilities and their limits." He turns to you with an appraising look. "I could use someone like that in my service. What do you say?"

This decision could change everything. The knight's offer is tempting, but you've already learned so much from Cedric, and there's clearly more he could teach you.
