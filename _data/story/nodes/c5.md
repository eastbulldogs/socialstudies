title: Read Message
---

Your hands tremble slightly as you carefully peel back the hidden message. The charcoal writing is faint, but you can make out what looks like a coded message: "New moon. East gate. Silver for silence." Below that are strange symbols that must mean something to whoever wrote them.

The main message to the steward suddenly feels much less important. As you read the hidden note again, pieces start falling into place. Earlier today, you delivered messages to the guard captain about scheduling, and you remember seeing fewer guards assigned to the east gate during the new moon – just two days from now.

Your stomach tightens. Could this be about smuggling? Or something worse? The symbols at the bottom remind you of marks you've seen on some merchants' crates – but these look different, almost like weapons.

Thomas's words from this morning echo in your head: "A good messenger sees everything." Well, you've certainly seen something now. But Thomas also said messengers are trusted with secrets – does that mean you should pretend you never saw this?

You glance out a narrow window and spot a group of unusual merchants in the courtyard, their clothes too fine for simple traders. One of them is staring at the east gate with great interest.

Time feels like it's slipping away, and either choice could have serious consequences for the castle. What's the right thing for a future knight to do?
