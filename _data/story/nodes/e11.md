"Thank you for the offer, Lord Morris," you say carefully, "but I think I'd rather find my own way." The steward raises his eyebrows, but you see a glimmer of respect in his eyes.

Instead of joining the steward's office, you throw yourself into learning everything you can about castle life. You spend mornings in the practice yard, afternoons helping in different parts of the castle, and evenings studying in the library. Without the steward's protection, some tasks are harder - but each victory feels truly yours.

"Interesting choice," the castle weapon master comments one day, watching you help younger students with their training. "Most would jump at the chance for an easy path to power. But you're building something different, aren't you?"

You create your own opportunities. When merchants arrive, you help organize their goods in exchange for lessons about distant lands. You volunteer in the stables, the kitchen, and the guard posts, learning how each part of the castle works. Some nobles look down on you for turning down the steward's offer, but others seem impressed by your independence.

One morning, you overhear two knights discussing a problem: someone has been stealing weapons from the armory, but they can't post more guards without alerting the thief. With your knowledge of every corner of the castle, you might be able to help - but getting involved could be risky without the steward's protection.

The decision weighs heavily. This could be your chance to show everyone the value of choosing your own path - but is trying to handle it alone worth the risk? Sometimes even the most independent spirit needs allies.
