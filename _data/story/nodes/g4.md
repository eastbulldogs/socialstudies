The signs appear slowly at first. While your sword skills continue to improve, you start noticing gaps in your training that you can't ignore. During a practice session, you fumble mounting your horse – something you used to do without thinking. When assigned to organize a patrol schedule, you struggle with the basic planning that other knights handle easily.

"Your bladework is exceptional," Sir Roland tells you one evening, his voice gentle but concerned. "But I watched you today. You couldn't read the simple trail signs that every knight should know. And last week, you had trouble helping with the castle's harvest festival because you didn't understand how to work with the villagers."

Your face burns with embarrassment as you remember other recent mistakes. The visiting lord who seemed offended by your lack of proper court manners. The time you couldn't help defend the castle gate because you'd never learned to use a bow. Even some of the younger pages know more about castle history and geography than you do.

"There's no shame in being the best at something," Sir Roland continues, watching you practice your sword forms. "But a knight needs to be ready for any challenge. What happens when you face a problem that can't be solved with a blade?"

That night, you can't sleep. You think about all the skills you've let slip away while focusing only on swordsmanship. Maybe it's time to step back and rebuild your foundation. But should you train alone, focusing on each skill one at a time, or join the other squires who might help you learn faster?

The decision weighs on you. Your sword skills are still valuable, but now you understand – being the best at one thing isn't enough if it leaves you unable to handle everything else a knight must do.

The path ahead feels humbling, but you know it's necessary. Sometimes moving forward means being willing to start over.
