title: Accept Honor
---

Your heart swells with pride as you step forward to accept the steward's offer of recognition. "The castle should know who helped save it," you say, your voice stronger than you expected.

The next few weeks pass in a whirlwind of preparation for the feast. Your friends help you practice proper court manners and teach you the formal words you'll need to say. Even Thomas spends extra time making sure your messenger's uniform is perfect for the ceremony.

The great hall glows with hundreds of candles on the night of the feast. Your hands tremble slightly as you stand before the assembled nobles, knights, and castle staff. The steward's voice rings out, telling the story of how you discovered the plot and helped prevent disaster. When he places the silver medallion of service around your neck, the applause fills the hall like thunder.

"Remember this moment," the captain of the guard tells you at the celebration afterward. "You've earned your place among the castle's heroes. But remember - true honor isn't just in earning glory, it's in living up to it afterward."

You start noticing changes in how people treat you. Guards salute when you pass, servants whisper excitedly when you enter rooms, and even some nobles nod in recognition. The attention feels wonderful, but sometimes uncomfortable too.

One morning, you overhear some older messengers talking. "Fame can be like sweet wine," one says. "A little can warm your heart, but too much can go to your head." You realize they're talking about you.

The medallion feels heavy against your chest as you consider your path forward. Will you rise to meet the high expectations everyone now has for you, or will the weight of honor prove too heavy to bear?
