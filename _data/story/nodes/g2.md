title: Break Away
---

The tension builds as you watch both teams practice. While everyone else seems excited about working together, something doesn't feel right to you. Your group had its own special way of doing things – your own style that made you unique. Now it feels like that's getting lost in all the complicated formations.

"I need to talk to you," you tell Marcus after practice one evening. Your stomach feels tight, but you know this is important. "I think... I think we're losing what made our team special. All these fancy moves are impressive, but they're not us."

Marcus listens carefully as you explain your concerns. Some of the younger riders are struggling with Sara's team's complex patterns. The horses seem more nervous with so many riders moving at once. Most importantly, the gentle, careful approach you developed is being overshadowed by the bigger, showier movements.

"Maybe you're right," Marcus says finally. "But breaking the alliance won't be easy. Sara's team is counting on us."

That night, you can't sleep. You keep thinking about your first days of training, when you learned that understanding horses was more important than impressing crowds. About how your team built something special by focusing on that connection.

The next morning, you gather your team. "I know this isn't going to be popular," you tell them, "but I think we need to find our own path again." Some nod in agreement, while others look uncertain. "We can learn from Sara's team without losing ourselves by joining them."

The decision feels heavy – this isn't just about one performance anymore. It's about what kind of rider, and person, you want to become.
