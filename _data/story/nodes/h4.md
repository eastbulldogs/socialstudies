title: Plan Fails
---

Your perfect plan falls apart in the most unexpected way. Just as you're about to begin, harvesters from the village arrive early for the feast – walking right through your carefully positioned lookout spots. The wagon you arranged to block the spy's escape route gets moved to make room for their carts. Even the lantern signal from the kitchen window is blocked by a banner someone hung for the celebration.

You watch helplessly as your careful preparations crumble one by one. "The spy's on the move," Thomas whispers urgently. "What do we do? This isn't anything like we planned!" Your mind races. None of your backup plans prepared for this many changes at once.

The spy reaches the old mill, but with your watchers out of position, you can't tell if he's met the bandits yet. The guard captain looks to you for direction – waiting any longer could mean losing everything, but moving too soon could spoil any chance of catching them all.

Your heart pounds as you realize that all your careful planning has come down to this moment. But maybe that's the lesson – no plan, no matter how perfect, can prepare for everything. What matters is how you handle things when plans go wrong.

"Sometimes," you remember Sir Roland saying, "a knight's true strength isn't in making the perfect plan, but in being ready when things go wrong." You know you have to make a choice right now:
- Take charge yourself and create a new plan on the spot
- Quickly gather your team and work together to find a solution

The whole operation hangs in the balance. You've learned that plans can fail, but that doesn't mean you have to fail with them. Maybe being adaptable is even more important than being perfect.

Looking at the chaos around you, you understand something important: real leadership isn't just about making good plans – it's about keeping going when those plans fall apart. Which kind of leader will you choose to be?
