When Marcus steps forward to lead the group, you find yourself nodding with approval. His calm presence has helped steady many nervous riders during practice, and you've seen how well he thinks through problems. "I'll help however I can," you offer, and the grateful smile he gives you confirms you've made the right choice.

Over the following weeks, you discover that being a good supporter is an art of its own. While Marcus handles the big picture of the riding display, you become his trusted right hand. You notice the small details he might miss – like how young Thomas tends to grip the reins too tightly when nervous, or how Sara's horse gets skittish during the afternoon sun.

"I don't know what I'd do without you," Marcus tells you one evening after practice. "You see things I miss, and the others open up to you about their worries." You've found that many riders feel more comfortable sharing their struggles with you than with their official leader. You help them practice difficult moves when no one else is watching and boost their confidence with quiet encouragement.

Word spreads beyond your group about how well you work together. Other training groups start asking for advice, wondering how your team has become so successful. Marcus always makes sure to mention your role, explaining how having a strong supporter has made all the difference.

One afternoon, Cedric pulls you aside after watching your practice. "You know," he says thoughtfully, "some might think you took the easier path by not leading." He watches as you help a younger student adjust their stirrups. "But I've been doing this long enough to know that the strongest chains need both links that shine and links that hold." He nods toward where several students are helping each other with their gear, following your example. "You've helped create something special here – a group that supports each other. That's rare... and valuable."

Later that day, you overhear two senior knights discussing your group's progress. "Their display will be impressive," one says, "but what interests me more is how they work together. We could use that kind of teamwork in the northern outpost."

You realize you're developing skills that go beyond horsemanship – you're learning how to help people work together, how to strengthen bonds between others, how to support without seeking the spotlight. These might not be the flashiest knightly virtues, but they feel deeply important.

As the day of the feast performance approaches, you see how your role has shaped the whole group. Marcus leads with confidence because he knows you've got his back. Other riders help each other more readily, having seen the value of support. The group feels less like a collection of individuals and more like a family.

You have to smile when you overhear one of the younger students say, "I want to be like them when I'm older – someone who makes everyone around them better." They weren't pointing at Marcus when they said it. They were pointing at you.

You're beginning to understand that there are many ways to serve, and sometimes the quieter paths lead to the most meaningful destinations. Your supporting role has taught you about building trust and fostering cooperation – skills that could help you forge strong alliances in the future.
