title: The Stables
---

The smell of hay and horses fills your nostrils as you approach the stables. Thomas, the stable master, is a tall man with weathered hands and keen eyes. He looks you up and down as Master Geoffrey introduces you.

"So, you want to work with horses, do you?" Thomas asks, leading you past stalls where magnificent warhorses and swift coursers stand. "Let's see what you're made of. We've got a situation that needs handling."

You follow his gaze to a stall where a young, spirited horse is pawing at the ground, clearly agitated. Its coat is lathered with sweat, and none of the stable boys seem eager to approach.

"That's Thunder - new arrival and not yet used to castle life. We need to calm him down before he hurts himself. What's your thought, lad?"
