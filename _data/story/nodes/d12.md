title: Focus on Training

"I'm honored by your trust," you tell the steward and captain carefully, "but I think I have more to learn before taking on such important duties." Thomas gives you an approving nod that makes you stand a little straighter.

"A wise choice," the captain says. "Knowing your own readiness is as important as any other skill." He and the steward leave, but Thomas stays behind.

Over the next weeks, your messenger training intensifies. Thomas teaches you the proper way to handle everything from simple notes to royal proclamations. You learn the complex system of castle protocols - which messages need immediate delivery, which require formal ceremonies, and which should be quietly slipped under doors without being seen.

"Being a messenger isn't just about carrying messages," Thomas explains one day as you practice proper scroll-sealing techniques. "It's about being a vital part of how the castle works. Every person, from the highest lord to the newest stable boy, depends on us doing our job properly."

One evening, while sorting messages in the messenger's common room, you overhear two senior messengers discussing your progress. "The young one has talent," one says. "Could become the fastest message runner we've ever had with proper focus. Though they might do better as a ceremonial courier - they certainly have a good head for protocol."

Thomas approaches you later. "They're both right," he says with a thoughtful smile. "You could focus on becoming the best at one aspect of messenger work, or you could train in all the different skills we use. It's time to choose your path."

The decision will shape all your future training. Would it be better to be outstanding at one thing, or capable at everything a messenger might need to do?
