title: Tell Authority
---

Your heart races as you walk to the castle steward's office. You know the hungry families need help, and maybe the proper authorities can provide it better than secret handouts. The steward, Lord Morris, listens carefully as you explain about the struggling villagers and their reluctance to ask for help directly.

To your surprise, he doesn't seem angry about the food being taken. Instead, he starts asking detailed questions about which families are having the most trouble and what specific help they need. He even sends for Marta to join the discussion.

"This is exactly the kind of thing we need to know," Lord Morris says, nodding approvingly. "A good castle takes care of its people - but we can't help if we don't know there's a problem." He turns to Marta. "Can we establish a proper system for distributing leftover food to those in need?"

Marta's eyes light up as she suggests ways to help without disrupting kitchen operations. Soon, plans are being made for a weekly village food distribution, with proper records and organization.

Word spreads quickly about how your choice to speak up is helping the whole village. Other castle officials begin to notice you. They praise your judgment in bringing the problem to the right people instead of letting it stay a secret that could have caused more problems.

One morning, Lord Morris calls you back to his office. "You've shown good instincts for handling delicate matters," he says. "I could use someone with your qualities as my assistant. You'd learn how the castle really runs - politics, diplomacy, administration. Or," he gestures to the busy courtyard below, "you could return to your regular duties. Not everyone is suited for political life, and there's no shame in that."

The decision weighs heavily. Working with the steward could give you more chances to help people - but politics can be a difficult and complicated path.
