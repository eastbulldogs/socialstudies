title: Miss Opportunity
---

Looking back, you realize you might have been too cautious in declining any recognition. The special team moved forward without you, and sometimes you catch glimpses of them heading out on important missions, wondering if you should have joined them. One quiet evening, while organizing messages in the tower room, you overhear two guards talking about a group of suspicious travelers approaching the castle. They mention signals that remind you of the codes you helped break during the merchant plot. Your heart races - this could be connected to the very people you helped stop before.

Thomas finds you later, a knowing look in his eyes. "Sometimes life gives us second chances," he says, pulling out a sealed message. "The captain's team could use someone with your skills right now. A fresh start, if you're interested." He explains that the suspicious travelers might be connected to a bigger plot, one that threatens not just the castle but the whole kingdom.

The weight of the decision feels heavy. This is your chance to make up for the opportunity you missed, but which approach would be wiser - rushing in to prove yourself, or showing you've learned to plan things carefully?
