title: Master Politics
---

Your heart races as you prepare to address the northern lords. Weeks of preparation with Lord Morris have led to this moment. The great hall feels different from this side of the table – you're no longer just watching noble politics, you're part of them.

"These trade routes affect us all," you begin, unrolling the map you've carefully prepared. You've marked it with colored inks showing how the new rules could benefit each region. "The northern mines need southern grain. The southern farms need northern metals. Working together, both sides prosper."

The northern lords exchange glances, their earlier hostility softening as you explain your ideas. You remember Lord Morris's lessons – speak simply, show respect, but stand firm when you know you're right.

"But the tolls are too high," one lord protests.

"That's why we've prepared this new proposal," you respond, presenting the document you spent days perfecting. "Lower tolls for essential goods, with guards provided by both north and south. Shared costs, shared benefits, shared responsibility."

To everyone's surprise, the northern lords begin nodding. Your simple, fair solution makes sense to everyone. As the lords sign the agreement, Lord Morris beams with pride.

Later, in his office, he raises a cup of cider in your honor. "You've got a gift," he says. "Not just for solving problems, but for helping others see how working together benefits everyone. That's what a true political knight does."

Looking out the window at the northern and southern banners flying together over the castle gate, you realize you've found your path. Not all victories come from strength of arms. Sometimes the greatest triumphs come from the power of words, wisdom, and understanding.

You've become what you were meant to be – a knight who serves the realm not with a sword, but with a steady hand at the wheel of governance. Your skills bring people together, turn rivals into allies, and help build a more united kingdom.

The young boy who once stood nervously in the castle courtyard has grown into something special – a political knight who knows that true power lies not in forcing others to submit, but in helping them work together for the good of all.
