title: Train with Others
---

The training yard buzzes with energy as you join the daily group lessons. It's different from working alone - there's talking and laughter mixed with the sounds of hooves and tack. At first, you worry it might be distracting, but soon you discover that working with others makes learning even more exciting.

You learn things you never would have figured out alone. Sara knows a trick for getting horses to lift their hooves for cleaning, while Marcus shows you how to braid manes so they don't tangle during rides. In return, you share the gentle approach that helped you calm the wild stallion. Soon, everyone's skills begin to improve faster than before.

Cedric watches with approval as your group tackles increasingly difficult challenges together. When someone struggles, others step in to help. When someone succeeds, everyone celebrates. You find yourself at the center of many of these moments - sometimes teaching, sometimes learning, but always part of the team.

One day, Cedric presents your group with a special challenge: prepare a complex riding demonstration for an upcoming feast day. It will require perfect timing and cooperation between multiple riders. Everyone turns to you, remembering how well you handled the wild horse incident.

"You've shown a gift for both horsemanship and working with others," Cedric says. "The group clearly respects you. But leading them through this would be a big responsibility. You could also support another leader and focus on perfecting your own part of the display."

Your fellow students wait eagerly for your decision. Either way, you'll be part of something bigger than yourself - but which role would serve the group best?
