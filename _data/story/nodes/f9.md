title: Failure
---

Your heart sinks as you watch your careful plans crumble. Red Jack laughs at your offer of honest work, tossing aside the gesture of shared food. "You think we want to be errand boys for the castle?" he sneers. "This is who we are now, boy. Best you learn that some people can't be changed."

Some of his men had seemed interested in your idea, but their leader's mockery silences any support. Worse, your attempt at peace seems to have made him angry.

"Since you're so eager to share the village's food," Red Jack growls, "we'll take it all. And extra, to teach you the cost of wasting our time."

The bandits take twice what they originally demanded. You watch helplessly as they load sack after sack onto their horses. The villagers' winter stores, meant to last months, disappear in an hour.

Back in the village hall, people try to figure out how they'll survive the coming months. "At least no one was hurt," Sarah whispers, trying to comfort you. But you can see the worry in every face.

That night, unable to sleep, you walk through the quiet village. Your mind races with new ideas - there must be a way to fix this, to help these people who trusted your judgment.

The next morning, you return to the castle and seek out Sir Roland. "I tried to solve it peacefully," you tell him, "but I only made things worse. Now the village has less food than ever."

Sir Roland listens carefully to your story. "Sometimes our greatest tests come not from our failures," he says, "but from how we respond to them. The village still needs help. You could take charge yourself, create a new plan alone. Or you could gather others, build a team to solve this together. Both paths could work, but you must choose."

The weight of the village's problems feels heavy on your shoulders. Can you trust yourself to handle this alone after your failed negotiation, or is it time to learn the strength of working with others?
