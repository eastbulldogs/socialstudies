title: Get Overwhelmed
---

The heavy responsibility of the northern lords' negotiations starts to feel overwhelming. There are so many details to remember - which lord prefers which trading terms, who's feuding with whom, what promises were made to each person. Your neat desk becomes buried under scrolls and documents. Even with Lord Morris's help, you find yourself making mistakes.

"The grain tax should be two copper pieces per sack, not three," a senior clerk points out one morning, catching an error in your calculations. That afternoon, you accidentally schedule two different lords to meet with the steward at the same time. By evening, you're mixing up which messenger should carry which private letter.

That night, you sit alone in the quiet office, staring at the piles of work still to be done. You remember simpler days when your biggest worry was organizing kitchen supplies or delivering messages on time. Maybe you weren't ready for such important duties after all.

Lord Morris finds you there, looking at your latest mistake - a trade agreement with all the numbers wrong. Instead of being angry, he sits down next to you with a kind expression.

"You know," he says gently, "I made the same mistake when I was starting out. Tried to run before I could walk. Sometimes we need to step back and build a stronger foundation." He pauses thoughtfully. "Actually, I've heard that Sir Edwin is looking for a new squire. He's strict but fair, teaches everything from the ground up. Or you could stay here, starting with simpler duties until you're ready for more."

The decision weighs on you. Would it be better to start over with someone new, or rebuild your confidence where you are? Either way, you know you need to learn more before taking on such big responsibilities again.
