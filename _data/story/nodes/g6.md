title: Jack of All Trades
---

While others focus on mastering single skills, you discover your strength lies in being able to handle almost anything adequately. No, you're not the best swordsman – but you're good enough to hold your own in practice. You're not the finest horseman – but you can ride well enough to complete any mission. You know enough about castle politics to avoid trouble, enough about healing to help in emergencies, enough about cooking to survive in the field.

"Interesting approach," Sir Roland comments one day, watching you switch easily from archery practice to helping in the forge. "Most try to excel at something specific. But you've become good at... well, everything."

At first, some joke about you being a "jack of all trades, master of none." But then situations arise where your versatility proves invaluable. When a storm damages the castle wall, you help organize repairs, cook for the workers, tend to minor injuries, and keep the horses calm – all in the same day. During a diplomatic visit, you smoothly shift from stable duty to serving at the feast to standing guard.

Your finest moment comes during the spring festival. The usual master of ceremonies falls ill, and no one person can handle all his duties. But you can. You coordinate the events, judge the competitions, help manage the feast, and even step in to demonstrate several different skills. Not perfectly, but well enough.

"We would have needed five different people to replace him," the steward says afterward. "But you adapted to each task as needed. That's a rare gift."

You become known as the Versatile Knight, trusted not for mastery of any one thing, but for being ready for everything. Other knights might do individual tasks better, but none can handle so many different challenges with such steady reliability.

"The realm doesn't always need the best," you often tell young pages who worry about not excelling at anything specific. "Sometimes it just needs someone who can do what's needed, when it's needed."

Looking at your well-worn equipment – sword showing regular use, armor bearing marks from many different duties, tools hanging ready at your belt – you see the knight you've become. Not a master of any single art, but capable in all of them. Your story teaches others that there's more than one way to serve, and that being ready for anything can be just as valuable as being the best at something.

You've become what every Versatile Knight should be – someone who proves that true worth isn't always found in mastery, but in being someone others can always count on, no matter what the challenge might be.
