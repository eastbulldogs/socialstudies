title: Withdraw
---

Standing in the tournament preparation area, you watch the other riders warming up their horses. The noise, the crowds, the pressure – it all feels wrong somehow. You think about your quiet mornings in the stables, the peaceful connection you built with the horses. This isn't why you fell in love with riding.

"Cedric," you say, approaching your mentor. "I... I don't think I'm ready for this."

The stable master studies your face carefully. "It takes courage to walk away," he says quietly. "Sometimes more than it takes to compete."

You spend the rest of the day helping younger students with their horses instead of preparing for your own competition. To your surprise, it feels right – like coming home after a long journey. You realize that somewhere along the way, in your drive to become the best, you lost touch with what made you love horsemanship in the first place.

Over the next few days, you return to the basics. You relearn things you'd started taking for granted – the proper way to approach a nervous horse, how to check hooves for problems, the importance of patience over speed. Other students join you sometimes, and you find yourself enjoying the company you once avoided.

One morning, an older knight watches you helping a young rider overcome their fear of mounting. He speaks quietly with Cedric, both of them nodding as they observe your gentle guidance of both horse and rider.

"Sometimes we must step back to move forward," the knight says, approaching you. "How would you like to learn about more than just horses?"

Your decision to withdraw from the tournament has led you to an unexpected crossroads. Which path will you choose?

You have to make a choice:
- Accept the knight's offer and begin a new path
- Stay loyal to Cedric and your work in the stables
