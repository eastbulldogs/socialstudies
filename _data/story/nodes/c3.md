title: Report Thief
---

Your heart hammers as you hurry to find Marta. "Someone's been taking food from the storage room," you whisper, pulling her aside. "I just saw – there are fresh footprints, and the salted pork barrel is too empty."

Marta's round face grows serious as she listens. She gathers a few trusted kitchen workers, and together you return to the storage room. The child is gone, but Marta spots something you missed – a small gap in the stone wall where a loose brick has been removed, creating a hidden passage to the outside.

"Well spotted, young one," Marta says, her voice mixing pride with concern. "This explains why our stores have been disappearing faster than they should. But..." She pauses, looking troubled. "Times are hard in the village. Sometimes hungry people do desperate things."

Word spreads quickly through the kitchen about how you helped discover the theft. The other workers start treating you differently – not just as another pair of hands, but as someone they can trust. But you also notice tension growing between two groups: those who want stricter security and punishment for thieves, and those who think the kitchen should find ways to help feed the hungry villagers.

To your surprise, both groups want you on their side. One of the senior cooks, Master Gilbert, offers to teach you his prized recipes if you'll support his strict new security rules. Meanwhile, his rival, Clara, suggests working together to convince Marta to start a program that would use leftover food to help feed poor families.

The kitchen staff watches, waiting to see which path you'll choose. Each one offers a different kind of respect – but they can't both be followed.
