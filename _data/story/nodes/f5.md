title: Balance
---

"I want to learn everything I can," you tell Sir Roland. Your mentor's weathered face breaks into a warm smile. "The path of balance is challenging," he says, "but it can lead to great wisdom."

Your training becomes more varied than ever before. Each day brings different lessons: mornings might find you practicing archery, afternoons working with horses, and evenings studying maps and battle strategies. You learn to cook from the castle chef, tend wounds from the healer, and even pick up some blacksmithing skills.

"A well-rounded knight," Sir Roland explains while watching you switch from sword practice to horseback riding, "is like a master key that can open any door. You might not be the best at everything, but you'll never be helpless in any situation."

Other squires start coming to you for help – not because you're the best at any one thing, but because you understand enough about everything to solve unusual problems. When someone's horse throws a shoe far from the castle, you know enough about both horses and metalwork to help. When a hunting party needs to track prey and treat a wound, you can do both.

But mastering so many skills isn't easy. Sometimes you feel stretched thin, like you're always just "good enough" at everything but never reaching excellence. You watch specialists excel in their chosen fields and wonder if you're making the right choice.

One day, while helping organize a castle feast, Sir Roland poses a question: "You've learned to handle many different challenges," he says. "Now you must decide – will you work to truly master this balance of skills, or embrace being a jack of all trades? Both paths have their own kind of honor."

The decision feels important. Will you find a way to excel at everything, or discover that there's strength in being adaptable? Your future as a knight hangs on this choice.
