Without hesitation, you run to find Thomas. Your heart pounds as you pull him into a quiet corner and show him both messages - the official one and the hidden note. His usually cheerful face grows serious as he studies the coded writing.

"You did the right thing bringing this to me," he says in a low voice. "We've been watching these so-called merchants for weeks. Come with me - quickly."

To your surprise, Thomas leads you to a hidden room behind the kitchens where the castle guard captain and several trusted knights are already gathered. Maps and documents cover the tables, and you recognize some of the same symbols from the coded message.

"Our young messenger found the proof we needed," Thomas announces. The guard captain motions you forward, and you explain everything - the message, the suspicious scheduling around the east gate, your concerns about weapons being smuggled in.

"Perfect timing," the captain says grimly. "We knew they were planning something, but not exactly when or where. Thanks to you, we can stop them before they even begin."

Over the next two days, you help the captain's team by carrying seemingly ordinary messages that are actually secret signals. When the night of the planned attack arrives, the false merchants find themselves walking straight into a trap.

After the plotters are arrested, the castle steward himself comes to thank you. "The whole castle owes you a debt," he says. "We'd like to recognize your service publicly at the next feast. You'd be honored before the entire court." He pauses. "Unless you'd prefer to keep your role quiet? Sometimes a messenger's greatest strength is that no one knows their true importance."

The decision feels weighty. Public recognition could open new doors, but there's also value in being trusted to work quietly behind the scenes.

You have to make a choice:
- Accept the public honor and recognition for your service
- Stay humble and continue your work quietly in the background
