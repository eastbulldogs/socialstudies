For weeks, you spend every spare moment with the horses, often working late into the evening after other students have left. Cedric arranges for you to use the training yard during quiet hours, and you develop your own special ways of communicating with each horse. You learn to read their smallest movements - a flick of an ear, a shift of weight, the meaning behind different kinds of snorts and whinnies.

Your riding skills grow incredibly fast. You master techniques that take others months to learn, creating a unique bond with each horse you train. Even the most difficult horses seem to understand you. The stable hands whisper that you have "horse magic," though you know it's really just practice and patience.

But while your connection with horses deepens, you notice yourself growing distant from the other students. You eat meals alone so you can return to the stables faster. When others invite you to games or gatherings, you usually decline, preferring to spend time with your four-legged friends. Sometimes you catch glimpses of the other students laughing together, sharing jokes and stories you don't understand anymore.

One morning, Cedric finds you already working in the stables before dawn. "You've become one of the finest young riders I've ever seen," he says, watching you guide a horse through a complex series of movements. "The summer tournament is coming up. With your skills, you could make quite a name for yourself." He pauses, studying your face. "But I worry you're forgetting that knights need to work with people too, not just horses. Maybe it's time to practice with others again?"

The decision weighs heavily on you. You love the quiet understanding you've found with the horses, but is Cedric right about needing to connect with people too?

You have to make a choice:
- Enter the tournament to prove your riding skills to everyone
- Take a step back and try to reconnect with your fellow students
