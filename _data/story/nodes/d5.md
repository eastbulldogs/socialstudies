Your decision to work with Master Gilbert changes everything. The stern cook takes you under his wing, teaching you secret recipes passed down through generations of castle chefs. Your days become a blur of precise measurements, perfect timing, and endless practice. You learn the difference between cooking and true culinary mastery.

"Cooking is an art of discipline," Master Gilbert often says as he watches you work. "Every movement must have purpose." Under his strict guidance, your skills grow rapidly. Soon you're mastering dishes that even experienced kitchen workers find challenging. Other students watch with a mix of admiration and envy as you earn more of Master Gilbert's rare praise.

Then comes the announcement: the castle will host a feast for visiting nobles, and each senior cook can enter one student in a competition to prepare the main course. Master Gilbert immediately names you as his choice. "Show them all what real talent looks like," he says with fierce pride.

The day of the competition arrives. The kitchen buzzes with nervous energy as five students begin their preparations. You notice some of the others struggling - especially Clara's student, who seems overwhelmed by the complex recipe. You know a few tips that could help, but Master Gilbert's words echo in your mind: "In the kitchen, as in life, we must each prove our own worth."

To your delight, your dish turns out perfectly. The judges praise its flavors and presentation. As they prepare to announce the winner, you see both hope and worry on your fellow students' faces. You realize your next actions could either unite or divide the kitchen.

The kitchen staff watches closely. Will you use this moment to build bridges or to establish yourself as the kitchen's rising star?

You have to make a choice:
- Share your victory by praising everyone's hard work and offering to teach others
- Embrace your moment of personal triumph and advancement
