title: Struggle and need allies
---

Despite trying to handle the armory thefts alone, you quickly realize you're in over your head. The weapons master has doubled the guards, making it harder to watch the armory. And the suspected thieves seem to know when you're watching - they must have friends helping them.

One afternoon, you nearly get caught hiding behind some barrels. If the guard had looked just a little to the left... Later that night, safe in your quarters, your hands still shaking, you have to admit the truth: you can't do this alone.

You think about everyone you've met in the castle. The stable hands who taught you about timing guard patrols. The kitchen workers who know everyone's routines. The messengers who see everything but never get noticed. You might not have the steward's protection, but you have something else - connections with people throughout the castle.

The next morning, you start reaching out. "I could use some help," you tell Sarah in the kitchen. Her face lights up - she's been wanting to prove herself too. By evening, you have a small group of trusted friends: Sarah from the kitchen, Thomas from the messenger service, and Marcus from the stables.

"We've all noticed strange things," Marcus says during your first secret meeting. "But none of us had the whole picture." Together, you start piecing together the puzzle. Sarah's noticed supplies going missing that could feed a group hiding in the forest. Thomas has seen suspicious messages. Marcus knows which horses return with signs of long, hard riding.

You can see strengths in both paths. Together, you have a better chance of success - but it means learning to trust others and maybe not getting all the credit. The choice you make now will shape not just this mission, but your entire future as a knight.

But working with others isn't as easy as working alone. Some want to act too quickly, others want to wait too long. Arguments break out about the best way to catch the thieves. You realize you have to make a choice:
