title: Earn respect
---

"Thank you, but I'd rather not have any special recognition," you tell the steward quietly. "I was just doing what any messenger should do." Your words seem to surprise him, but you notice Thomas nodding approvingly from the corner.

You return to your regular duties, but things feel different. Even without a ceremony or medal, word of what you did spreads through the castle. People treat you with new respect, though it's quieter than if you'd accepted public honors. Kitchen workers slip you extra treats, guards share friendly nods, and older messengers start teaching you their special tricks.

"There's wisdom in your choice," Thomas tells you one afternoon while showing you a secret passage. "Some of our best messengers are the ones nobody notices. They see more that way, help more that way."

You discover he's right. Without the attention that would have come with public recognition, you can move more freely through the castle. You notice things others miss, help solve small problems before they become big ones, and learn secrets that people only share with those they trust completely.

Then one day, Thomas brings unexpected news. "The captain of the guard is forming a special team," he whispers. "Secret work, very important. He specifically asked if you were interested - said he was impressed by someone who chose quiet service over glory."

You realize this could be an even bigger opportunity than the public honor you turned down. But it would mean leaving your comfortable routine for dangerous, demanding work.

The decision weighs on your mind. Is this the universe's way of rewarding your humility, or would taking on such important work go against the very qualities that made you worthy of it?
