title: Stand Together
---

Your decision to join forces with Sara's team transforms both groups in ways you never expected. In the days leading up to the feast, you watch in amazement as riders who once competed against each other now work seamlessly together. When Thomas struggles with a complex formation, a rider from Sara's team stays late to help him practice. When one of their horses gets spooked, your team's gentle approach helps calm it.

The morning of the feast arrives with a buzz of excitement. As both teams gather in the practice yard for one final rehearsal, you notice something remarkable – you can no longer tell which riders came from which team. Everyone moves together like they've been training as one unit forever.

"Whatever happens today," Sara tells the group, "we've already won by becoming something greater than we could have been alone."

The performance itself becomes legendary in castle history. The crowd gasps as twenty riders and horses move in perfect harmony, creating patterns more beautiful and complex than any single team could have managed. When one horse hesitates at a crucial moment, three riders smoothly adjust their positions to cover the mistake. Not a single person in the audience notices the error – they only see the flawless teamwork that fixes it.

After the final bow, as thunderous applause fills the courtyard, you see tears of joy in several riders' eyes. Even the older knights seem amazed. "In all my years," you hear one say, "I've never seen such perfect unity between riders and horses – and between riders themselves."

You become known throughout the castle as the Unifier Knight – someone who brings people together and helps them become stronger than they ever could be alone. Other training groups start following your example, learning that cooperation achieves more than competition.

Years later, when you have students of your own, you often tell them: "A knight's greatest strength isn't in standing alone, but in helping others stand together. For when we unite our skills and spirits, we create something truly magical."

Looking at the strong bonds between riders, the lasting friendships that grew from rivalry, and the way your example continues to inspire others, you know you've found your true calling. You've become what every Strong Alliance Knight should be – someone who shows that the greatest victories come not from defeating others, but from helping everyone rise together.
