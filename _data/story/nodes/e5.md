title: Quiet Service and Growth
---

"I'd prefer to focus on learning and serving," you tell Sir Roland quietly. He studies your face for a moment, then nods with approval. "There's wisdom in that choice. Not every valuable lesson needs an audience."

Your days fall into a steady rhythm of service and learning. While other squires practice showy sword moves in the courtyard, you spend dawn hours with Sir Roland mastering the basics. "A knight's strength grows from their foundation," he often says while correcting your stance or adjusting your grip.

You learn in ways you never expected. While polishing Sir Roland's armor, he teaches you about the different fighting styles of neighboring kingdoms. As you help in the stables, he explains battle strategy using the way horses move in herds. Every task becomes a lesson, if you pay attention.

Other knights begin to notice how you work. They see how you anticipate needs before they're spoken, how you solve problems quietly instead of seeking praise. "That one has the right spirit," you overhear one senior knight tell Sir Roland. "Reminds me of how you were at that age – more interested in doing what's right than looking right."

One morning, Sir Roland presents you with a choice. "You've learned much," he says, watching as you expertly check his mount's hooves. "It's time to choose your path forward. You could focus on mastering one particular skill – become the finest swordsman, the best rider, or the most skilled strategist. Or you could continue as you have been, learning a bit of everything, becoming well-rounded but perhaps never the best at any one thing."

You think about all you've learned so far. About how different skills connect in unexpected ways. About how being good at many things has helped you serve better. But you also remember the satisfaction of truly mastering something, like when you first learned to calm frightened horses.

"There's no wrong choice," Sir Roland adds, seeing your thoughtful expression. "Both paths can lead to knighthood. The question is, what kind of knight do you wish to become?"

Your steady path has brought you this far. Now you must decide how to continue growing - by diving deep into one skill, or by expanding your knowledge across many.
