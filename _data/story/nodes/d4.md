Cedric's weathered face breaks into a rare smile when you tell him you're staying. "Loyalty is a knight's virtue too," he says, clasping your shoulder. "Let's see what we can make of you."

Your training intensifies. Cedric doesn't just teach you about horses anymore - he shares wisdom about the castle, its people, and what it truly means to serve. You learn that status isn't just about titles, but about earning trust. Other stable hands begin coming to you for advice, and even some of the younger knights stop to watch your training sessions.

One evening, Cedric takes you aside. "You've grown more than I hoped," he says. "The other students look up to you now, especially since you chose to stay. But that means more responsibility." He shows you a letter from a neighboring castle. They're sending a group of untrained warhorses - powerful but dangerous animals that need careful handling.

"Usually, I'd handle this myself," Cedric continues, "but I'm needed at the northern stable for the next week. Someone needs to oversee the new horses' arrival and first days of training." He studies you carefully. "You could take charge of this yourself - you certainly have the skill. Or you could work with the other senior students as a team. It's your choice, but remember - these horses could hurt someone if things go wrong."

The weight of the decision settles on your shoulders. You know you have the skill to handle this alone, but would it be wiser to rely on others? The safety of both horses and students hangs on your choice.

You have to make a choice:
- Take full responsibility for handling the dangerous new horses
- Gather a team of experienced students to help manage the situation
