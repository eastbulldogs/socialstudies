title: Keep some secret
---

"I need to tell you something important," you say to Thomas, carefully choosing your words. "But first, I need your advice on how to handle this properly."

Over the next hour, you share most of what you've discovered about the plot - the suspicious merchants, the coded messages, the scheduled guard changes at the east gate. But you leave out certain names, especially those of people you're not completely sure about. Better to be careful than to accuse someone wrongly, you think.

Thomas listens carefully, his expression growing more serious with each detail. "You're right to be cautious," he says finally. "In the messenger service, we learn that some truths are like arrows - once released, you can't take them back."

Together, you take your findings to a trusted senior guard. You explain about the weapon smuggling plot, focusing on the parts you can prove. You describe the suspicious activities but don't mention the high-ranking people you suspect might be involved - at least not yet.

"There's something else," the guard says, studying your face. "Something you're not telling us." It's not a question. "Sometimes half a truth can be more dangerous than a lie. If you know more, we need to hear it."

You think about the names you're keeping secret. If you're wrong about them, you could ruin innocent lives. But if you're right and say nothing, you could be putting the castle in danger.

Your stomach twists as you consider your options. The right path seems harder to see with each passing moment. Is it wiser to protect people from accusations you're not certain about, or could holding back information put everyone at greater risk?
