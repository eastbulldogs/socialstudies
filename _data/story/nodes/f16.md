title: Balance Truth
---

When you speak to the guard captain, you choose your words carefully. "There's a plot to smuggle weapons through the east gate," you explain. "I can prove the merchants are involved, and I know which night they plan to do it. But I need more time to be certain about everyone else who might be helping them."

The captain studies your face. "You know more than you're saying," he observes. "But you're being careful about it. Good."

Over the next few weeks, you work closely with the captain's trusted guards. You share what you know about the merchants' plans, but you also quietly investigate the guards you suspect. Instead of making accusations, you help arrange tests - special patrols, fake messages, marked coins - to prove which guards can be trusted and which can't.

"Strange," the captain says one day, after another corrupt guard has been caught through your careful planning. "How they seem to reveal themselves, given enough rope." He gives you a knowing look, understanding that this was your plan all along.

Your methodical approach pays off. One by one, the plotters are discovered, but in ways that protect both the innocent and the castle's security. Some of the guards you suspected turn out to be loyal after all - you're glad you didn't accuse them too quickly.

At your knighting ceremony, the castle steward presents you with an unusual gift - a pair of scales made from polished silver. "For someone who understands that wisdom lies in balance," he explains. "In knowing when to speak, when to watch, and when to wait."

You become known as the Wise Knight, someone who can be trusted with both secrets and truth. People come to you not just with information, but for advice about how to handle difficult situations. Your quiet guidance helps prevent problems before they start.

"Truth is like a strong wine," you often tell younger pages who seek your counsel. "Pure, it can be too powerful. Hidden, it turns sour. But properly shared, it brings clarity and wisdom."

Looking at your reflection in the silver scales, you see the knight you've become - neither a revealer of all truths nor a keeper of dark secrets, but something more valuable: a seeker of wisdom who knows that true justice requires both courage and discretion.

You've become what every Wise Knight should be - someone who understands that truth and wisdom must work together, that protecting the innocent sometimes means being careful with the truth, and that the greatest victory often lies not in what you reveal, but in how you reveal it.

Your legacy isn't in dramatic revelations or hidden mysteries, but in the wisdom of finding the right path between extremes. You've proven that sometimes the truest strength lies not in speaking everything you know, but in knowing what needs to be spoken and when.
