"I want to help," you tell the steward and captain, trying to keep your voice steady despite your excitement. Their approving nods make your heart swell with pride.

"Good," the captain says, pulling out a detailed map of the castle and surrounding lands. "We believe someone has been leaking information about our guard patrols to bandits in the area. But we need proof - and that's where you come in."

Over the next few days, you learn the art of being invisible in plain sight. Thomas teaches you to change your walking style, how to look busy while actually watching someone, and ways to remember conversations word for word. You start carrying special messages - some real, some fake - to see who might be interested in them.

"The trick," Thomas explains during one of your lessons, "is to be so ordinary that no one looks twice at you. Even when you're doing the most extraordinary things."

Your first real test comes sooner than expected. The captain believes he knows when the next secret meeting between the spy and the bandits will happen. But getting close enough to overhear them will be incredibly dangerous.

"You don't have to do this," Thomas says quietly. "We could wait, plan more carefully, find another way." But you can see in his eyes that time might be running out.

Everything you've learned as a messenger has led to this moment. But which approach would a true knight take - bold courage or careful wisdom?
