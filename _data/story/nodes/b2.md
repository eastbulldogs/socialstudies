title: The Kitchen
---

The warmth hits you first as you enter the castle kitchen, along with the rich aroma of fresh bread and herbs. Agnes, the head cook, is a stout woman with flour-dusted hands and sharp eyes that miss nothing. She pauses in her work at a large wooden table as Master Geoffrey makes introductions.

"Another pair of hands, eh?" she says, looking you over. "Well, timing couldn't be better. We've got a feast to prepare for tonight - Lord Edmund's returning from his travels." She gestures to the organized chaos around you, where kitchen boys and scullery maids hurry about their tasks.

"But first," she continues, lowering her voice, "we've got a more pressing matter. Someone's been taking extra food from the pantry - not much, mind you, but enough to notice. This morning, I saw a boy about your age sneaking away from the kitchen with a loaf of bread under his shirt."
