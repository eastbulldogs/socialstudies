"I would be honored to learn from you, Lord Morris," you say, standing a little straighter. The steward's face breaks into a warm smile as he begins showing you around his office.

Your days take on a new pattern, very different from your previous kitchen duties. You learn to read and write official letters, to use the special seals that mark important documents, and to keep track of the castle's many needs in huge leather-bound books. Most importantly, you learn about the people - who to talk to when things need to get done, how to handle disagreements between different groups, and when to bring problems to Lord Morris's attention.

"Politics isn't just about fancy words," Lord Morris explains one day while teaching you how to organize trade agreements. "It's about understanding what people need and finding ways to help them work together."

You start small, helping settle disputes between servants or organizing schedules for visiting merchants. But as weeks pass, Lord Morris trusts you with bigger tasks. Soon you're helping arrange important meetings and offering suggestions about how to solve problems between the castle and village.

One morning, Lord Morris calls you to his office looking more serious than usual. "The northern lords are visiting next month," he says, spreading a map across his desk. "They're unhappy about our new trading rules, but we need their support for the winter grain storage plan." He looks at you thoughtfully. "You've shown a talent for bringing people together. Would you like to help me plan these negotiations?"

You understand this is no small offer. The northern lords are known for being difficult to please, and their support is crucial for the castle's plans. This would be your biggest challenge yet.

Your answer could set the course for your future in castle politics. Are you ready to step into the complicated world of noble politics, or would it be wiser to stay with simpler duties until you've learned more?
