title: Tournament Entry
---

The summer tournament arrives with a burst of color and excitement. Banners snap in the wind as knights and nobles from neighboring castles stream through the gates. For the first time in months, you find yourself distracted from your training routine by all the activity.

The tournament includes events for squires and students, with the horse-riding competition being one of the most prestigious. From your quiet corner of the training yard, you watch other young riders practicing their routines. Their movements are good, but you know yours are better after all your solitary practice.

"You could win it all, you know," Cedric says, appearing beside you. "Your riding is far beyond your years." He hands you a tournament entry scroll, the parchment thick and official-looking. "But tournaments aren't just about skill. They're about performing in front of crowds, handling pressure, dealing with other competitors."

You look down at the scroll, your stomach doing flips. You've perfected your riding through countless hours of private practice. But competing would mean putting yourself at the center of attention, something you've gradually grown less comfortable with during your months of solitary training.

Through the gate, you spot some of your former training companions laughing together as they practice. They've grown too, though differently than you. They might not have your refined skills, but they seem confident and at ease with the tournament's social atmosphere.

"There's no shame in waiting," Cedric says gently, noting your hesitation. "You could keep training and enter next year instead. Though sometimes," he adds with careful wisdom, "the longer we avoid something, the harder it becomes."

The entry scroll feels heavy in your hands. You've worked so hard to develop your abilities, but is competing worth stepping out of the quiet world you've built for yourself?
