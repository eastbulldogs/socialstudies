title: Lose Trust
---

Your attempt to handle the truth carefully backfires badly. Some of the information you tried to keep quiet gets revealed anyway, but now it looks like you were trying to hide it. Even worse, one of the innocent guards you wrongly suspected finds out you were investigating them.

"I thought you were trustworthy," they say, hurt and anger in their voice. Soon that feeling spreads through the castle. People who used to greet you warmly now turn away when you pass. Conversations stop when you enter rooms.

One particularly hard afternoon, you overhear two senior knights talking: "Shame about that one. Had promise, but you can't trust someone who plays games with the truth."

Your heart feels heavy as you realize how much damage your careful planning has caused. That evening, you seek out Thomas, your old messenger mentor, hoping he at least will understand.

"Trust is like a mirror," Thomas tells you gently. "Once cracked, you can't just pretend it isn't broken. But..." he pauses thoughtfully, "while you can't undo what's done, you can rebuild. It won't be easy, though. You'll have to prove yourself all over again, and this time, people will be watching more closely."

You realize he's right. Your old reputation is gone, but maybe that's not the end. Maybe it's a chance to build something new, something better.

The path ahead looks harder than ever, but at least now you understand what's truly at stake. Sometimes you have to lose something to understand its real value.
