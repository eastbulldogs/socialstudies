After much thought, you tell Sir Roland you want to focus on mastering one skill completely. His eyes light up with approval. "A wise choice. Which path calls to you most strongly?"

You choose swordsmanship. Something about the blade's elegant movements speaks to your heart. Sir Roland arranges for you to train with Mastersmith Jonas to learn everything about swords - from forging to fighting.

Your days take on an intense new rhythm. Dawn finds you practicing basic sword forms in the quiet courtyard. Mornings are spent in the forge, learning how different types of steel affect a blade's strength and flexibility. Afternoons are devoted to advanced training with Sir Roland, who teaches you fighting techniques passed down through generations of knights.

"Focus is like a blade," Jonas tells you one day, holding up a sword you helped forge. "The sharper it is, the deeper it can cut."

Your dedication begins to show results. You master moves that leave even experienced knights nodding in appreciation. Your understanding of swords becomes so deep that you can tell a blade's quality just by its ring when struck.

But you start to notice other things too. While you excel with a sword, you struggle during archery practice. Your horsemanship skills, once quite good, begin to fade from lack of practice. Some other squires even joke that you've forgotten how to do anything except swing a sword.

One evening, Sir Roland finds you still practicing as the sun sets. "Your sword work is remarkable," he says. "But remember - a knight must be ready for any challenge, not just the ones they prefer. You could continue on this path, becoming truly elite with a blade. Or you could start branching out again, becoming more well-rounded."

The weight of your sword feels familiar in your hands as you consider your path forward. Will you become the finest swordsman in the realm, or is it time to expand your horizons?
