Your heart races as you carefully approach the frightened stallion. You remember Cedric's lessons from earlier: stay calm, move slowly, speak softly. The horse's ears flick toward you as you speak in gentle tones, just like you did with the calmer horses this morning. "Easy there, big fellow. Let's get that rope off your leg."

The courtyard is silent except for your voice and the horse's nervous shuffling. You can see Cedric watching from across the yard, ready to help if needed, but letting you try. Keeping your movements smooth and steady, you edge closer to the stallion. Its dark eyes follow you, but it's not rearing anymore – it's listening.

Finally, you're close enough to reach the tangled rope. Your fingers tremble slightly as you work to free it, all while keeping your voice steady and calm. The moment the rope falls away, you feel the horse relax. When you carefully stroke its neck, the stallion lets out a soft snort and lowers its head.

Cedric's usually stern face breaks into a broad smile as he approaches. "Well done, lad! That took real courage – and more importantly, real skill. You've earned yourself a place in advanced training." He pauses, looking thoughtful. "Now you've got a choice to make. I can arrange for you to have extra training time alone with our best horses – you clearly have a gift. Or you can join the regular group lessons, where you'll work with other students."

The choice feels important. Training alone could make you an exceptional horseman, but working with others might teach you things you'd never learn by yourself.

You have to make a choice:
- Train alone with the horses, developing your special connection with them
- Join the group lessons and learn alongside other students
