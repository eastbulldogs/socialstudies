title: False Pride
---

The attention that comes with your silver medallion starts to change you. After the big ceremony, you begin to expect special treatment. When stable hands don't bow quite low enough, you frown. When the kitchen staff doesn't serve you first, you clear your throat loudly until they notice your medallion.

"Did you hear about how I caught the plotters?" becomes your favorite way to start conversations. You tell the story again and again, making your role bigger each time. Some of the younger pages still look impressed, but you notice others starting to roll their eyes when you walk by.

One morning, you're supposed to help train new pages in sword practice, but you show up late, expecting everyone to wait for you. "I'm sure you all heard about my special recognition," you tell them with a proud smile. "So watch carefully - this is how a real hero fights."

But you haven't been practicing as much lately - too busy telling stories about your achievements. When you demonstrate a simple sword move, you stumble. Some of the pages giggle. Your face burns with embarrassment, and you snap at them harshly, making one of the youngest ones cry.

That afternoon, you're summoned to the guard captain's office. His face is grave as he places a letter on his desk. "We've had complaints," he says quietly. "From the stable master, the kitchen staff, your fellow squires, and now the parents of that young page. This isn't what we honored you for."

You start to protest, to remind him of your great deed, but he holds up his hand. "A single brave act doesn't give you the right to treat others poorly. You have a choice to make. You can either take charge of fixing this situation yourself, or we can assign you to work with a team who will help you remember what true honor means."

Your medallion feels heavy around your neck as you consider your options. Maybe it's time to remember what you did to earn it in the first place - not just catching plotters, but caring about doing the right thing.
