title: Face Consequences
---

Standing before the castle council, your voice stays steady as you reveal everything you've discovered. You name every person involved in the plot - from the guards who changed the schedules to the servants who passed secret messages. Some of the council members shift uncomfortably when you mention names they know well.

"I have proof for everything," you say, showing your carefully coded notes and the hidden messages you've collected. The guard captain asks sharp questions, but you answer each one clearly and honestly. You can see some of the accused plotters in the back of the hall, their faces dark with anger.

The next few weeks aren't easy. Some people stop talking to you. You hear whispers of "traitor" and "spy" when you walk through certain parts of the castle. But others - especially those who had suspected something wrong but were afraid to speak - start treating you with new respect.

"It takes rare courage," the guard captain tells you one evening, "to speak truth when staying quiet would be easier. Especially when the truth affects powerful people."

Slowly, things begin to change. The plotters are dealt with fairly - some punished, others given a chance to make amends. More importantly, people start coming to you with other problems, knowing you'll handle the truth with care and courage.

Your knighting ceremony comes with an unusual addition. The castle steward presents you with a special medallion - a crystal prism that catches the light and splits it into clear, bright colors. "Like truth itself," he says, "showing things as they really are."

You've become known as a Truth-bearer Knight - someone who can be trusted to uncover what's hidden and speak what needs to be said, no matter how difficult. It's not always an easy path, but you know it's the right one.

"The realm needs knights with strong arms," your old mentor Thomas tells you, "but it needs knights with honest tongues even more. You've become something special - a knight who fights with truth as your weapon."

Looking at your reflection in the prism medallion, you see the person you've become - someone who chose the harder path of honesty and helped make the castle a more truthful place. You've proven that sometimes the greatest courage isn't in swinging a sword, but in speaking truth when others won't.

You've become what every Truth-bearer Knight should be - someone who proves that honesty, even when it's difficult, makes the whole kingdom stronger. Your legacy won't be in battles won, but in truths revealed and justice served through the power of honest words.
