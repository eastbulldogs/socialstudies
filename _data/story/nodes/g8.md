title: Seek Help with a Team Solution
---

"I can't do this alone," you admit, surprising yourself with how good it feels to say those words. Whether dealing with the dangerous new warhorses or trying to make up for past mistakes, you know you need help.

You start by gathering people you trust - Thomas from the stables, Sarah from the kitchen, and a few other squires who've always shown good judgment. Instead of trying to prove yourself, you ask for their ideas and really listen.

"The younger horses respond better to a gentle approach," Thomas suggests during your first meeting. Sarah adds, "And if we rotate the work teams, everyone can learn from each other's strengths."

To everyone's surprise, your willingness to ask for help inspires others to do the same. Suddenly, the whole group feels different. People who used to struggle in silence now speak up when they need support. Those who used to compete start working together.

"Interesting," Sir Roland comments one morning, watching your team work seamlessly together. "Sometimes the bravest thing a leader can do is admit they don't have all the answers." You realize he's right - by seeking help, you've actually made the whole group stronger.

The best part is how problems seem smaller when faced together. When a particularly nervous horse won't cooperate, one person remembers a calming technique while another knows the perfect treat to earn its trust. What might have been a crisis becomes just another challenge to solve as a team.

Either way, you've learned something valuable - that true strength often comes from being willing to ask for help when you need it.
