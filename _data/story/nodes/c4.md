title: Help Hungry Child
---

Instead of raising the alarm, you quietly approach the child. "Wait," you whisper, making sure no one else can hear. "I don't want to hurt you. I just want to talk."

The child freezes, clutching a small bundle of salted meat to their chest. You can see now it's a girl about your age, her clothes worn but clean. Her eyes dart toward the exit, but something in your voice makes her hesitate.

"My little brother's sick," she says finally, her voice barely a whisper. "We haven't had proper food in days. Father lost his job at the mill, and—" She stops, looking ashamed.

Your mind races back to Marta's earlier lessons about the castle's abundance. "Wait here," you tell her. You quickly gather some of the day's leftover bread and vegetables – food that would have been thrown out anyway. "Take these too. They're fresh, and no one will miss them."

The girl's eyes fill with tears of relief. As she accepts the food, she tells you about a group of village families who help each other survive hard times. They share what little they have, take care of each other's children, and keep each other's spirits up. But they're too proud to ask the castle for help directly.

Just then, you hear footsteps approaching the storage room. You have to make a choice:

Your decision could change many lives – but which path would help them best? The secret weighs heavy on your heart.
