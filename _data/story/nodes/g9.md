title: Bold Action
---

The night air feels thick with tension as you crouch behind an old oak tree near the forest's edge. After days of careful preparation for catching the spy, this is your moment to act. Your heart pounds, but your hands are steady as you check that your messenger's bag is secure - you'll need to move fast and quiet.

"Remember," Thomas had warned, "if you're going to do this, you'll only get one chance. The spy is meeting their bandit contact tonight. We could wait, plan more carefully..." But you know waiting could mean losing them forever.

Through the evening mist, you spot the telltale lantern signal from the east tower - the spy is moving. You recognize the figure's walk even in the darkness: it's one of the senior guards, just as you suspected. He thinks no one is watching as he slips through the castle's side gate.

Years of messenger training have taught you every shadow of the castle grounds. You follow silently, using the techniques Thomas taught you - rolling your feet to stay quiet, freezing when the guard glances back, keeping to the deepest shadows.

The guard heads toward the abandoned mill where, according to your intelligence, the bandits are waiting. You have to make a choice right now that could change everything:

There's no time to second-guess yourself. Either choice is risky, and both could lead to disaster if you're not careful. But isn't this exactly what you trained for? The path of a hero isn't always clear, but sometimes you have to trust your instincts and act.
