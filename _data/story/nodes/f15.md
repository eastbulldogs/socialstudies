title: Hide Truth
---

You decide to hold back some of what you know. "I can tell you about the merchant's plot," you tell the guard captain, carefully avoiding mention of the high-ranking guards involved. "But I'm... not sure about anything else."

The captain arrests the merchants, and at first, it seems like you made the right choice. The castle celebrates the discovery of the plot. You even receive praise for your help. But the truth you're hiding starts to weigh on you.

Every time you pass one of the corrupt guards in the hallway, your stomach twists. They give you knowing smiles, aware that you've protected them. Some even start asking you for small favors, reminding you with meaningful looks that you share their secret.

Your dreams become troubled. You imagine what might happen if the plotters try something worse next time, knowing they can get away with it. When younger pages ask you for advice, the words stick in your throat - how can you tell them to be honest when you're carrying this burden?

Your knighting ceremony should be the proudest day of your life. But as you kneel to receive your sword, you feel the weight of the secrets you keep. The knight's oath includes the words "to uphold truth and justice," and each word feels like a stone in your heart.

You become known as a capable knight, but always quiet, always careful. Other knights notice how you keep to yourself, how you never quite meet their eyes during important discussions. They call you the Burdened Knight, though they don't know why.

"Something shadows your spirit," your old mentor Thomas tells you one day, his eyes kind but sad. "A knight's strength comes from being true to themselves. Whatever you carry, it's not too late to set it down."

But you know it's not that simple anymore. The truth you hid has grown roots, tangling with other secrets, other choices. You're a knight now, but not the kind you dreamed of being. Your days are spent looking over your shoulder, wondering if today will be the day your silence finally costs too much.

You've become what you never wanted to be - a knight whose armor shines on the outside but who carries darkness within. Your story becomes a quiet warning that sometimes the heaviest burdens are the truths we choose not to tell.

Perhaps someday you'll find the courage to speak the whole truth. Or perhaps you'll carry this weight forever, a reminder that every choice has its price, and that honor, once compromised, leaves a shadow that no amount of polish can remove.
