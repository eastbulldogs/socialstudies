title: Live up to Honor
---

When the silver medallion is placed around your neck at the feast, you make a silent promise to yourself. This honor isn't just a reward - it's a responsibility. Over the following months, you work harder than ever to prove yourself worthy of the trust the castle has placed in you.

You throw yourself into your duties with new energy. When a stable hand needs help training a difficult horse, you're there before they even ask. When the kitchen is short-handed during a feast, you pitch in without being prompted. You start arriving early to practice sessions and staying late to help younger pages with their lessons.

The captain of the guard notices your dedication. "Some let honor go to their heads," he says one morning, watching you help clean practice swords after everyone else has left. "But you've let it lift your heart instead."

Your example inspires others. Younger pages try to copy your work ethic, and even some of the older squires start showing more dedication to their duties. The castle steward often points to you when teaching new arrivals about proper behavior.

"Honor isn't about the medallion," you tell a young page who asks about your award. "It's about making choices that help others trust in goodness." You realize you've grown to truly believe these words, not just say them.

Your knighting ceremony arrives on a bright spring morning. As you kneel to take your vows, you see faces in the crowd that tell your story - the guards you helped, the servants you defended, the young pages you've guided. Each one is part of how you've lived up to the honor given to you.

The Lord of the castle himself speaks at your ceremony. "Some knights earn their title through great deeds," he says. "But the finest knights earn it through small deeds done greatly, day after day. That is what we see before us - someone who has made honor not just a medal worn, but a path walked faithfully."

You become known as the Honored Knight, not just because of the medallion you wear, but because of how you've lived since receiving it. When people speak of honor, they often point to your example - not of someone who did one great thing, but of someone who does each small thing with great care.

Looking at your reflection in your polished shield, you see the knight you've become - someone who proves that honor isn't just about receiving recognition, but about living every day in a way that makes that recognition mean something.

You've become what every Honored Knight should be - someone who shows that true honor isn't in the medals we wear, but in the choices we make and the lives we touch. Your story teaches others that the greatest honor isn't in being celebrated as a hero, but in living each day as someone worthy of being one.

Your legacy isn't just in the silver medallion that started your journey, but in all the lives you've helped make better by choosing, each day, to be the kind of person that medallion represents.
