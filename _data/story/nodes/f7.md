title: Lose Battle
---

The signal leaves your lips, but something goes wrong. The bandits are more prepared than you expected. When your villagers emerge from hiding, several more bandits appear from the shadows behind them. They'd been watching, waiting, planning.

"Did you think we wouldn't scout the village first?" their leader laughs. "That we wouldn't notice your little preparations?"

Your carefully planned defense falls apart. The villagers fight bravely, but the bandits are experienced fighters. The miller's sons get separated. The blacksmith's daughter's shield techniques work at first, but the bandits quickly adapt. You try to reorganize everyone, but there's too much chaos.

"Stop!" you shout finally, seeing villagers getting overwhelmed. "We yield. Please, no one else needs to get hurt."

The bandit leader raises his hand, and his men lower their weapons. "Smart choice, kid. Here's how this works - we'll take our payment, plus extra for the trouble. And if anyone thinks about trying this again..." He lets the threat hang in the air.

That night, as you help tend to minor injuries in the village hall, your heart feels heavier than the grain sacks the bandits took as payment. "I'm sorry," you tell the village elder. "I failed you all."

But the elder's response surprises you. "Failed? Look around," he says. You see villagers helping each other, sharing what food remains, already planning how to recover. "We lost the fight, yes. But we found our courage. That's worth more than a few sacks of grain."

Still, the defeat teaches you hard lessons. You realize that courage alone isn't enough – you need more skills, better planning, deeper understanding. Back at the castle, you request a meeting with Sir Roland.

"I want to learn more," you tell him. "Not just fighting, but everything that makes a true knight. I never want to fail those who trust me again."

Sir Roland nods thoughtfully. "There are two paths before you. You could focus on becoming a warrior, mastering every aspect of combat. Or you could learn a broader range of skills – strategy, diplomacy, leadership. Which would serve better next time?"

The memory of the failed battle weighs on your mind as you decide. Sometimes losing a fight teaches more than winning one – but what exactly is the lesson you should learn?
