title: Lead
---

As you step forward to lead the group, a feeling of nervous excitement fills your chest. "I'll do it," you say, trying to sound more confident than you feel. The smiles and nods from your fellow students help steady your nerves.

Over the next few weeks, you discover that leading is about much more than just giving orders. You learn to listen to everyone's ideas, finding ways to combine different suggestions into something better than any one person could have created alone. When Sara suggests a complex weaving pattern for the horses, you pair her with Marcus, whose steady patience helps make the tricky moves possible.

The practice sessions become the highlight of everyone's day. You create a system where riders rotate positions, so everyone learns every part of the display. When someone struggles, you remember how it felt to be alone with the wild stallion and take time to work with them one-on-one. Your quiet understanding of horses helps you teach others, while their energy and enthusiasm push you to try new things.

Word spreads about what your group is creating. Other students start coming to watch your practices, and even some of the knights pause to observe. You notice Cedric watching too, a proud smile on his weathered face.

The day of the feast arrives all too quickly. Just before your group enters the display yard, you gather everyone in a circle. Looking at their nervous but excited faces, you realize how far you've all come together. "Remember," you tell them, "we're not just showing them our riding skills. We're showing them what we can achieve when we work as one."

The demonstration goes better than you could have dreamed. Horses and riders move as one unit, weaving complex patterns that draw gasps of admiration from the crowd. When one rider almost misses a turn, another smoothly adjusts to cover the mistake. You lead from the center, your quiet signals guiding the whole group through the intricate dance.

After the final bow, as the crowd cheers and your friends gather in a laughing, congratulating circle, Cedric approaches with several senior knights. "That," he says, looking at all of you with pride, "is what true leadership looks like. Not just mastering skills yourself, but helping others master them too."

The knights nod in agreement. "We could use more young leaders like you," one says. "Someone who understands that the greatest achievements come from bringing out the best in others."

As your friends pull you back into their celebration, you realize you've found something more valuable than just becoming a skilled rider. You've learned that real leadership isn't about standing above others â€“ it's about helping everyone rise together. Your path to knighthood is clear now, built on the foundation of trust and teamwork you've created here.

You've become more than just a leader. You've become the kind of person who makes everyone around them better, and that, you now understand, is what being a true knight is all about.
