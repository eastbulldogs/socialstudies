title: Negotiate
---

You choose to seek a peaceful solution. "Fighting isn't the only way to be brave," you tell Sarah, remembering lessons from the castle. "Sometimes the hardest battles are won with words."

Over the next few days, you gather information about the bandits. The villagers share what they know - which bandits seem kinder, which ones are most aggressive, where they make camp. You learn that their leader, a man called Red Jack, used to be a merchant before bad luck turned him to banditry. Most importantly, you discover they've been having trouble trading their stolen goods in other villages.

You develop a plan that's as clever as any battle strategy. The village miller helps you draft a proposal: instead of stealing food, the bandits could help protect the trading routes between villages, earning an honest living. You know the castle has been looking for more road patrols - if the bandits proved trustworthy, they might even earn legitimate work.

When the night comes for the bandits to return, you're ready. Instead of an ambush, you've arranged a meeting in the village square. Torches light the area, and you've made sure everyone can see there are no weapons - but also made sure the bandits can spot the strongest villagers standing ready, just in case.

Red Jack arrives with his men, looking suspicious at the peaceful welcome. You step forward, your heart pounding but your voice steady. You explain your proposal, watching their faces carefully. Some look interested, especially when you mention legitimate work with the castle.

"Pretty words," Red Jack says finally, "but why should we trust you?"

The entire village holds its breath, waiting to see if peace can really win over violence. Your next words could change everything.
