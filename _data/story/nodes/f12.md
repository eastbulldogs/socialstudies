When you spot the weapons being smuggled from the armory, you know this is your chance. Without the steward's protection, it's risky - but you've learned to trust your own judgment.

You spend days quietly watching the armory, using all the skills you've gathered. Your kitchen experience helps you time the guards' meal breaks. Your stable work taught you where to hide your horse for a quick escape if needed. Your practice yard knowledge shows you the perfect shadow spots for observation.

Late one night, you catch them in the act - three guards loading weapons into a merchant's cart. But instead of confronting them directly, you do something they don't expect. You trigger the stable doors to open, sending horses running through the courtyard. In the chaos, you "accidentally" knock over the cart, spilling the hidden weapons for everyone to see.

The weapons master arrives to investigate the commotion. The evidence is clear, and the smugglers are caught. But you make sure to slip away before anyone realizes you planned it all.

The next morning, though, the weapons master finds you. "Interesting how that cart just happened to tip over," he says with a knowing smile. "And how the horses just happened to get loose at exactly the right moment. The kind of plan someone could only make if they knew every part of castle life."

Word spreads quickly. Knights and masters who once dismissed you now look at you with new respect. They see someone who succeeded without anyone's protection - who learned the castle from the ground up and used that knowledge to protect it.

The weapons master speaks for you at the next council meeting. "This one chose the harder path," he tells the assembled knights and nobles. "Not climbing the usual ladders, but building their own. That's the kind of independence and courage we need in a knight."

Your knighting ceremony is different from most. Instead of one master speaking for you, representatives from every part of the castle - stable master, cook, guards, weapons master - all step forward to tell how you learned from them. You've become something unique: a knight who truly understands every aspect of castle life.

"You could have taken the easy path," the weapons master tells you later, "but you chose to prove yourself instead. That's what makes you a true self-made knight."

Looking at your new sword and the proud faces around you, you know you made the right choice. You're not just any knight - you're one who earned every step of the way, who proved that believing in yourself and working hard can lead to success, even if the path is harder.

You've become what every self-made knight should be - someone who succeeds through their own effort and determination, who proves that every challenge can be overcome with courage, wisdom, and faith in yourself.
